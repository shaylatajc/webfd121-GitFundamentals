# git init

The `git init` command is used to create an empty git repository.
If you wanted to create a new directort and initialize a git repository, you can do so with the following commands:
```
mkdir NewDirectory
cd NewDirectory
git init
```
Once inside the git repository, you can start using commands such as
[status](./status)
[add](/Add.md)
[commit](/commit.md)
[push](./push.md)and more.
Init will create the repository in the current directory and will encapsulate all content, including other directories.
